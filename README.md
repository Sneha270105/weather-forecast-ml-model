# 🌦️ Weather Forecasting using Python & Machine Learning

This project presents a **weather and climate prediction model** using **Python** and various **ML algorithms** such as linear regression, classification, logistic regression, decision trees, Naive Bayes, and more. The model analyzes historical weather data and predicts meteorological parameters like **temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity**, etc.
